  {name: "Arduino Uno", description: "The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. \r\n\r\nRevision 3 of the board has the following new features:\r\n* 1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. In future, shields will be compatible with both the board that uses the AVR, which operates with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operates with 3.3V. The second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes.\r\n* Stronger RESET circuit.\r\n* Atmega 16U2 replace the 8U2.", product_model_number: "R3", vendor_part_number: "50", vendor_name: "Adafruit", quantity: 8, unit_value: "24.949999999999999289457264239899814129", value: "199.599999999999994315658113919198513031", picture: "50-01.jpg", vendor_url: "http://www.adafruit.com/products/50", category: "Arduino", location: "H1LD1B1"},
